A photographic essay or photo-essay for short is a form of visual storytelling, a way to present a narrative through a series of images. A photo essay delivers a story using a series of photographs and brings the viewer along a narrative journey.[1]

Examples of photo essays include:

A web page or portion of a web site.
A single montage or collage of photographic images, with text or other additions, intended to be viewed both as a whole and as individual photographs. Such a work may also fall in the category of mixed media.
An art show which is staged at a particular time and location. Some such shows may also fall into other categories.
In fashion publishing especially, a photo-editorial â€“ an editorial-style article dominated by or entirely consisting of a series of thematic photographs.
